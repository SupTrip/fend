# Natural Language Processing

We will be building web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites. Using an exciting new api called Aylien, we can build a simple web interface to interact with their NLP system. This tool will give us back pertinent information about the article, like whether the content is subjective (opinion) or objective (fact-based) and whether it is positive, neutral, or negative in tone.


## Multiple Webpack Configurations

Here, we have two webpack config files for both development mode(webpack.config.dev.js) and production mode(webpack.config.prod.js )


## Start Command

To start the webpack dev server at port 3000. Run in development mode using

 $ npm run build-dev


 To start the webpack prod server at port 8081. Run in production mode using


$ npm run build-prod

$ npm run start

To stop simply use Ctrl + C

Enjoy and Learn Front End Development NLP project!!
